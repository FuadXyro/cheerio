Cheerio has a new website, and it's looking pretty good! This has been in the
works for a while, and we're excited to finally share it with you. Let's walk
through all that's new.

## Guides

The Cheerio website now features a set of guides, helping you get started with
the project. Even if you've used the project for a while, you might still learn
something new!

Get started with the [intro guide](/docs/intro).

## API Docs

API docs, the old focus of the website, have been moved to a subdirectory.

## Blog

We're also starting a blog, where we'll share updates about the project. Feel
free to subscribe [to the RSS feed](http://localhost:3000/blog/rss.xml)!
